In order to build eflex you need to have Erlang/OTP installed on your
system. It can be downloaded from www.erlang.org.

Ensure that the Erlang application wx is installed properly. This can
be done by issuing the command "wx:new()." in the Erlang shell. Do not
forget to enter the trailing dot before you press enter. There should
not be any error printouts. It could look like this:

    % erl
    Erlang R13B03 (erts-5.7.4) [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [rq:4] [async-threads:0] [kernel-poll:false]
    
    Eshell V5.7.4  (abort with ^G)
    1> wx:new().
    {wx_ref,0,wx,[]}
    2> halt().
    % 

Build the eflex tool with

    cd eflex
    make

or

   eflex/bin/eflex --make

Now you can start the tool with

    eflex/bin/eflex

If you just are curious and want to see how a standalone installation
of eflex will look like, you can do that with

   eflex/bin/eflex --install

If you want to create a self contained standalone installation of the
eflex tool, you can create that with

   eflex/bin/eflex --install TargetDir

Then the given TargetDir directory will be created for you. It will
contain the eflex tool as well as a stripped Erlang runtime system. It
is possible to move the entire standalone system on TargetDir to
another location without any re-installation.

The tool in the new installation can be started with

   TargetDir/bin/eflex
